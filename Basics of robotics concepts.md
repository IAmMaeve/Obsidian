# what are robots

the word robot litteraly comes from science fiction so fuck us for no longer using the word autonomaton 

robots are **THINGS** that **DO THINGS** **SOMEHOW**

**THE THINGS** are electrically powered, self moving devices

**THE THINGS** they do are their tasks

**THE SOMEHOW** is by using digital inputs to create mechanical outputs through a transfer of power


Robots are electrically powered self moving devices that transfer power according to digital inputs in order to accomplish tasks. 



## ..Electrically Powered..

The word robot has only really come around with the electronic aspects of moving machines. The Defenitions are wibbly wobbly but Steam powered mechanics are generally called autonomatons.

The source of power for the mechanics of a robot will come from a power supply that holds electrical charge.

## ..Self moving..

if you smack an orphan with a laptop when it tells you to, it is not a orphan smacking robot, it is just an ordinary computer, and you are a bit of a dick.

## ..Transfer Power.. 

Robots do not create power, they create MOVEMENT by somehow transfering electrical energy into kinetic energy. This is done almost exclusively through electromagnets. Infact we only actually use [[Motors]] and [[Solenoids]].

The ways in which a robot transfers power can also  be called its [[Mechanics]].

## ..Digital Inputs..
